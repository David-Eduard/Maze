&nbsp; &nbsp; I created a maze game in C++.  The game starts with a welcome message followed by instructions.

&nbsp; &nbsp; It has a map consisting of a matrix where the walls are "#" and the object you move is a "0".

&nbsp; &nbsp; At the end of the game you are congratulated for making it to the end.
